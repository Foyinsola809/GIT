Working with Branches

######   A git branch is used to creat different copy of a source code. In this new branch, one can proceed to make changes as suit, and this chnage is independent of the main copy. In practice, this is used to develop new feature on the application. As the initial code is untested it can not to be  added to the base code of the live application. Git branch is also useful for collaboration within remote environment , where developers can make diffrent branches while working on the same feature, and later converge all the branches to one branch.

Deleting A Git Branch

######  when a feature is added to an application, its often done in a feature branch. Usually this feature branch is deleted when the code must have been tested and merged into a staging or dev enviroment depending on the branch strateggy of the team.
